# Griffin's Weather App

Hello! Thank you for taking the time out of your day to check out my project!
This is a Weather Application that will display the tempature at your location or any other location.

### What is used within this project?
I have decided to use the [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) framework to develop this application, as it adheres to my coding style and it was the first option on google.
And for CSS, I used [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). This is day one and I just noticed tailwind and bootstrap will conflict. Will remove later.

### Why?
I want to develop this in order to showcase my skills as a developer and get out there, as well as hone my skills in these languages.

# Features

There will be a bar at the top of the interface, displaying a quote, welcoming, tempature, and icon of current weather.
There will be a graph, displaying the weather currently and within a certain timeframe.
There will be a text box informing you of the current weather conditions using a custom AI built to develop informed responses.

Im not sure i wanna go to sleep
